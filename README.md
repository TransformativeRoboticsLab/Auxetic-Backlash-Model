# Auxetic Backlash Model
This repository holds a set of programs to model the backlash in auxetic structures.

The backlash in an auxetic structure can be configured or programmed to design a shape-changing structure.

## Main Questions
- How can we build valuable shapes using the backlash present in series and parallel networks of auxetic linkages?
- What metrics in the structure lead to changes in a configuration space?
- How do we model backlash
